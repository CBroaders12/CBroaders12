### Hi there 👋

I'm Conor, a full-stack developer! I currently specialize in Node.js and React, but I like to play around with and learn new technologies to see what it out there. Learning is and always has been my primary drive, whether that means learning how to build something with new tools, or helping others do the same. When I am not at my computer coding I am probably reading, singing, or taking a walk.

****

### I am Currently:
- 💻 A Learning Assistant at [Eleven Fifty Academy](https://www.elevenfifty.org)
- 🎹 Working on a [Recital Planning Application](https://github.com/CBroaders12/recital-server)
- 🌱 Learning [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)
